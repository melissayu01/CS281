\begin{problem}[Neural Networks, 5pts]
    In the previous problem, we have implemented a Logistic Regression classifier using PyTorch.
    Logistic Regression can be seen as a 1-layer neural network. With PyTorch automatic differentiation,
    implementing a multi-layer neural network only requires incremental change to our logistic regression
    implementation.

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item Implement a multi-layer neural network for IMDB classification and report accuracy
              on the test set. You are free to design the network structure (number of hidden units,
              activation function) and choose the optimization methods (SGD or ADAM, regularization 
              or not, etc.).
        \item (Optional) Implement sentiment classification based on Convolutional Neural Networks.
              We recommend reading

              Note that in this part, you need to treat the text as a sequence of word vectors instead of bag-of-words.
              You can do this by forwarding \texttt{batch.text[0]} to 
              \texttt{torch.nn.Embedding(vocab\_size, embedding\_dim)}
              after setting the weights using the pretrained vectors from\\
              \texttt{text\_field.vocab.vectors}.
